## Project Description
This project conotains a 2 Player version of the TICTACTOE game and a Player VS AI version. 


## Rules
The goal of the game is to align 3 of your tokens before your opponent.
The basic commands to interact with the UI are shown at its launch.

## Workflow


## Organization
For this project I used a ToDo list in paper and a Trello agile CANVAS.

On the repository you can find the main.py file, which contains the basic 2 player version of the game, and soon a main_ai.py file, ready to be used in order to implement the AI thoght process.
